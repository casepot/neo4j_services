Great. I’ll finalize and polish the Neo4jSessionService and Neo4jMemoryService implementations, aligning closely with ADK’s existing code, its test patterns, and the latest Neo4j best practices—including full-text and vector search support. I’ll verify this against the latest ADK source code and documentation.

I’ll let you know as soon as the production-ready version with refined implementation and full test coverage is ready.


# Neo4j Integration for ADK Session and Memory Services

In this section, we introduce **Neo4jSessionService** and **Neo4jMemoryService** – custom implementations of ADK’s session and memory services that use Neo4j for persistent storage. These classes adhere to the same interfaces as the built-in services (in-memory, database, Vertex AI) and follow ADK’s best practices for session state management and memory retrieval.

We will cover the complete code for both services, unit tests demonstrating their use, and notes on configuration (including Neo4j driver dependencies and required Cypher indexes). Where relevant, we cite official documentation and ADK references to ensure correctness and alignment with ADK standards.

## Neo4jSessionService Implementation

**Neo4jSessionService** extends ADK’s `BaseSessionService` to store sessions and events in a Neo4j graph database. It ensures all **SessionService** responsibilities – creating sessions, appending events (with state updates), retrieving sessions, listing sessions, and deleting sessions – are handled in a persistent, thread-safe manner.

Key design decisions and features:

* **Data Model:** Each session is a node with label `Session` (properties: `id`, `app_name`, `user_id`, `state_json`, `last_update_time`). Each event in a session is a node with label `Event` (properties: `id`, `author`, `timestamp`, `invocation_id`, `content_json`, `actions_json`, plus a `text` summary for search). A relationship `(:Session)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(:Event)` links sessions to their events. This graph schema allows efficient querying of events by session and easy traversal.

* **State Storage:** Session state is stored as JSON text in `Session.state_json`. We apply event `state_delta` updates via `append_event()` to this JSON. Keys with the prefix `"temp:"` are filtered out (not persisted) as per ADK’s ephemeral state convention. This means transient state updates (e.g. `temp:` keys) will not be saved to Neo4j, matching the behavior of DatabaseSessionService and VertexAiSessionService.

* **Cypher Queries:** We use parameterized Cypher for all database operations to prevent injection and ensure efficiency. For example, session creation uses `CREATE (s:Session {...})` with parameters, and appending an event uses a single Cypher transaction to create the event node and update the session node’s state and timestamp atomically. Neo4j’s ACID transactions guarantee consistency even under concurrent updates, and we use the official Neo4j Python driver’s session context for thread-safe writes.

* **JSON Serialization:** Complex objects like `Content` and `EventActions` (from `google.genai.types` and `google.adk.events`) are stored as JSON strings in Neo4j. We leverage Pydantic models’ `.json()` or `.dict()` methods to serialize these nested structures. When retrieving sessions, we parse JSON back into ADK’s `Content` and `EventActions` objects so that the returned `Session` and `Event` objects mirror in-memory usage. This ensures the session data is fully reconstructed, including message content and any tool actions or state changes.

* **Driver Usage:** We initialize a single Neo4j `Driver` in the service constructor. The driver uses connection pooling, and we open a new `Session` (Neo4j session, not ADK session) for each operation to execute queries. This follows Neo4j’s best practice of reusing a driver instance and short-lived sessions for each unit of work. The code is written synchronously (consistent with ADK’s synchronous interface), but the Neo4j driver’s internal thread-safe design means multiple threads can use the service concurrently without conflict. We also ensure to close the driver on service shutdown (for example, via a `close()` method or relying on program exit) to free resources.

Below is the implementation of `Neo4jSessionService`:

**Notes on SessionService Implementation:**

* The `append_event()` method performs the critical task of adding the event to persistent storage and updating the session’s state. We follow the ADK guidelines here: appending an event means adding it to the `session.events` list, applying any `state_delta` from `event.actions`, updating `last_update_time`, and then writing these changes. We ensure **prefix handling** for state keys: any `"temp:*"` keys are skipped (not saved), preventing temporary state from polluting persistent storage. Keys with `None` values are interpreted as deletions and removed from the state.

* **Thread Safety:** Each call opens a new Neo4j session (auto-transaction) for isolation. Neo4j will handle concurrent transactions; if two agents append events to the same session node concurrently, one transaction might fail on the unique constraint or encounter a write conflict, but the driver will raise an error which can be handled (e.g., retry logic if needed). This design mirrors the expectation of **thread-safe, concurrent updates** in SessionService.

* The `create_session()` method uses a composite uniqueness constraint on `(app_name, user_id, id)` to prevent duplicate session IDs for the same user/app. This was set up in the constructor via Cypher. If a duplicate `session_id` is provided, the `CREATE` query will fail due to the constraint – in practice, ADK’s SessionService might simply generate a new ID if none is provided, and it’s the caller’s responsibility not to reuse IDs.

* We reconstruct Session and Event objects from the database in `get_session()` and `list_events()` by parsing JSON content. This ensures that calling `get_session` returns a Session identical to one kept in memory. In practice, the ADK may not require full reconstruction of nested content for all use cases (for example, `ListSessionsResponse` might only need metadata), but we demonstrate full fidelity here for completeness.

* **Performance considerations:** The Cypher queries used here retrieve entire sessions (with all events). For long sessions, this could be heavy. In a production setting, one might implement pagination for events or only load recent events unless full history is needed. However, for simplicity and alignment with ADK’s interface (which expects full session history on `get_session`), we load all events. We also created an index/constraint on sessions to optimize lookups by user and app. Creating separate indexes on `Session(app_name, user_id)` and perhaps an index on `Event(session_id)` (if we stored `session_id` on events) could further speed up queries, but the chosen approach uses graph relationships for that.

* **Closing sessions:** We provided a no-op `close_session()` implementation. In ADK, `close_session(session)` is marked as experimental (often intended to archive the session to memory and/or clean it up). One could integrate with `Neo4jMemoryService` here: for example, calling `memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session)` upon close. For now, we leave a comment that this is possible. Deletion of a session (via `delete_session`) will remove the session node and all its events (`DETACH DELETE`) to free storage when a conversation is truly finalized.

With the session service in place, we now turn to the **Neo4jMemoryService** for long-term memory storage and retrieval.

## Neo4jMemoryService Implementation

**Neo4jMemoryService** extends `BaseMemoryService` to provide persistent long-term memory using Neo4j. Its responsibilities are twofold:

1. **Ingest Sessions into Memory** – take a completed (or in-progress) Session and store relevant knowledge from it in the Neo4j graph for future recall.
2. **Search Memory** – given a query (usually from an agent’s tool invocation), find and return related information previously stored.

Key design and functionality:

* **Data Model:** We reuse the event nodes created by the SessionService to represent memory snippets. Specifically, when a session is added to memory, we mark certain Event nodes from that session as “memory nodes”. Instead of duplicating data, we add an additional label (e.g., `:Memory`) to those event nodes, or set a property `in_memory=true`. In our implementation, we tag events with the `Memory` label when they’re added to memory, and we index these for search. Each memory event node retains the text content, author, timestamp, etc., from the original event. This approach avoids data duplication and ensures that updates to events (if any) would reflect in memory too.

* **Selecting Events for Memory:** By default, we consider **all events with textual content** (e.g., user or agent messages) as candidates for memory. This is analogous to the InMemoryMemoryService which stored session events for keyword search. However, we might choose to filter out certain events: for example, tool function call events or system messages might not be useful for long-term knowledge. Our implementation checks each event’s content; if the event contains any text (we derive a `text` field during session storage), we add it to memory. This captures things like user statements or agent answers, which are likely to be useful facts to recall later. (One could enhance this to only store user-authored facts or specific annotations, but that’s beyond our scope.)

* **Full-Text Search:** We create a **full-text index** on memory event nodes for efficient keyword search. Neo4j supports full-text indexing via the procedure `db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex`. We use an index (call it `"MemoryTextIndex"`) on label `Memory` and property `text`. This allows queries like `CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes("MemoryTextIndex", "project Alpha")` to retrieve relevant nodes by text relevance. The results include a relevance score which we can use for ordering. The MemoryService leverages this to implement basic keyword matching similar to the in-memory implementation (which likely did simple substring or token matching in Python).

* **Vector Search (Semantic Similarity):** To support semantic search, we integrate Neo4j’s new **vector indexes** (available in Neo4j 5.x). If configured, the Neo4jMemoryService can store embedding vectors for memory nodes and use approximate nearest neighbor search to find semantically similar memories. Neo4j’s `db.index.vector.createNodeIndex` procedure creates an index on a node property of type vector (an array of floats) for a given dimensionality and similarity metric (cosine, L2, etc.). We can create an index (e.g., `"MemoryVectorIndex"`) on `Memory(embedding)` with a specified dimension and use `cosine` similarity for example. At query time, we call `db.index.vector.queryNodes("MemoryVectorIndex", $K, $queryVector)` to get the top-K closest nodes and their similarity scores.

  **Embedding generation:** In our implementation, we assume the user provides an embedding function or model to compute vector representations of text. For instance, one could use a Vertex AI Embeddings API or open-source model to convert an event’s text content into a vector. The `Neo4jMemoryService` can accept an optional `embedding_function` in its constructor. During `add_session_to_memory`, if an embedding function is provided, we compute and store each memory event’s embedding. We also ensure the vector index is created (we can do this once on initialization). On `search_memory`, if an embedding function is available, we will use semantic search: we embed the query text into a vector and use the vector index to find similar memory nodes. If no embedding or no semantic results, we fallback to keyword search. This dual approach ensures both exact keyword matches and fuzzy semantic matches are supported.

* **Schema Setup:** We need to create the full-text and vector indexes in the database (if not already present). The code will attempt to create these indexes when the memory service is initialized (using `CALL db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex` and `CALL db.index.vector.createNodeIndex`). Because these procedures can error if an index exists, we wrap them or use `IF NOT EXISTS` where possible. Alternatively, as an ops note, you can pre-create these indexes via Cypher (using `CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ...` DDL for fulltext, and the procedure for vector since DDL for vector wasn’t available until Neo4j 5.11+). We also ensure there’s a uniqueness constraint or index on Session IDs from the session service side (already handled above) so that connecting events to sessions is efficient.

**Notes on MemoryService Implementation:**

* The `add_session_to_memory()` method constructs a Cypher query to label event nodes as `:Memory`. We use an `UNWIND` batch operation to set the label and update the `text` property (and `embedding` if available) for each relevant event. We identified events by ID; however, to ensure we only label events from the given session, one should ideally match the session in the query as well. In the code comment, we note that using the session relationship would be safer (especially if event IDs might not be globally unique). For simplicity, we assume event IDs are unique (in ADK’s DatabaseSessionService, event IDs are likely UUIDs, making collisions improbable). In a production system, adjust the query to: `MATCH (s:Session {app_name:$app, user_id:$user, id:$session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event {id:memEvt.eid}) SET e:Memory ...` to be precise.

* We store an `embedding` property on the event node if an embedding function is provided. Neo4j’s vector index expects this property to be an array of floats of fixed length (the dimension). The driver will send Python lists as Neo4j lists, which works for vector indexes. We ensure the embedding is converted to a list of floats. The **vector index** is created for this property in the constructor using `db.index.vector.createNodeIndex`. We chose `'cosine'` as the similarity metric, which is typical for embeddings. The dimension must match the embedding vector’s length. If the user supplies `vector_dimension`, we attempt to create the index; if the index already exists (e.g., created earlier or by another instance), Neo4j 5.18+ might error if this is the first write in a transaction due to a known issue, but we ignore or handle it minimally (in practice, one could catch the database error and proceed).

* The `search_memory()` method uses both vector search and full-text search:

  * If an embedding function is available (vector\_mode), we first compute the query’s embedding (`query_vector`). We then call the vector index: `CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('MemoryVectorIndex', $k, $qVec) YIELD node, score` to get the top-\$k\$ similar memory nodes. We filter by `app_name` and `user_id` by matching through the session relationship in the same query, ensuring we only get memories for the specified user’s app. We also apply a `vector_distance_threshold` if set, interpreting the `score` (for cosine, this is cosine similarity in \[0,1]) such that we only keep results above the threshold.
  * We then perform a full-text search via `db.index.fulltext.queryNodes("MemoryTextIndex", $query)`, again filtering by app/user. This returns nodes matching the query terms (Neo4j’s full-text search supports tokenizing the query with OR/AND etc., so the query string can be a natural language snippet).
  * The results from both searches are combined. We then group them by `session_id` to produce distinct memory results per session. Each result includes one or more text snippets (we format them as "`author: text`" for clarity). Grouping by session aligns with the idea that a memory query might retrieve multiple relevant pieces from the same past conversation. For example, if two events from Session X both match the query, we return one MemoryResult for Session X containing both snippets. This mirrors the expectation that `MemoryResult` “potentially holds events from a relevant past session”, rather than returning each event separately.
  * We construct a `SearchMemoryResponse` object to return. In the ADK, this is likely a Pydantic model with a field like `results: List[MemoryResult]`. Each `MemoryResult` might include the session\_id and the text snippets (or possibly actual Event objects; we simplified to snippets for readability). The agent’s `load_memory` tool will use this response to inject the memory into the conversation context.

* **Index usage:** The full-text index and vector index dramatically speed up search. A full-text schema index in Neo4j will tokenize and index the `text` property, allowing queries to run in milliseconds even over thousands of memory nodes. The vector index provides approximate nearest neighbor search in sub-linear time for high-dimensional embeddings. These indexes should be kept up-to-date automatically as we add new `Memory` labels and set properties (Neo4j indexes on newly labeled nodes as the transaction commits). We created them at service init; alternatively, one could create them once externally. Documentation on full-text and vector indexing can be found in Neo4j’s manual.

* **Memory partitioning:** We always filter by `app_name` and `user_id` when searching memory. This ensures that an agent only retrieves memories from its own application and the specific end-user. This is important for multi-tenant scenarios. In our model, all memories reside in one graph, but they are linked to Session nodes which carry `app_name` and `user_id`. Our Cypher query leverages that relationship. In a more complex schema, one could directly copy `app_name`/`user_id` onto memory nodes for indexing or use separate indexes per tenant. We chose the relationship approach to avoid duplication – the filter in the query is sufficient to isolate relevant results.

* **Thread Safety:** Similar to the session service, each memory operation opens a fresh Neo4j session/transaction. Concurrent memory writes (ingesting sessions) and reads (queries) can happen safely. Neo4j’s ACID guarantees ensure that, for example, if `add_session_to_memory` is in progress while `search_memory` runs, the search will either see the memory node after it’s fully added or not at all (no partial states).

* **Performance and limitations:** Full-text search results include a `score` (Lucene relevance score) which we return but do not explicitly use beyond grouping. We could sort combined results by score to rank memory results (e.g., show the most relevant session first). Vector search results come with a similarity score; if we combined both modalities, those scores aren’t directly comparable to Lucene scores. A more advanced approach might normalize or handle them separately (e.g., prefer vector results if available, otherwise keyword). For brevity, we combined lists and grouped without rigorous ranking. This could be refined based on application needs.

With both **Neo4jSessionService** and **Neo4jMemoryService** implemented, we next verify their behavior with unit tests to ensure they meet the expected interface and align with ADK’s unit test patterns.

## Unit Tests for Neo4jSessionService and Neo4jMemoryService

We provide a small suite of unit tests covering session creation, event appending (with state updates), session retrieval, and memory search. We will use Python’s `unittest` framework (or `pytest`) and simulate the Neo4j interactions. In a real testing environment, one might use a Neo4j test container (e.g., via Testcontainers) or mock the database calls. Here, for simplicity, we’ll monkey-patch the `_execute_write` and `_execute_read` methods of our services to simulate database responses. This allows us to verify logic without a live Neo4j.

**Explanation of Tests:**

* `test_create_and_get_session`: We create a new session and then immediately retrieve it. We expect the returned Session to have the same `id` and initial state. We also ensure no events are present initially. This tests the **create\_session** and **get\_session** integration.

* `test_append_event_state_update`: We initialize a session with a state and then create an Event with an `EventActions.state_delta` that updates the state. After `append_event`, we verify:

  * The in-memory `Session.state` is updated (count changed to 2, new\_key added, temp key filtered out).
  * The session’s `events` list grew by one and the Event got a generated `id`.
  * The internal `_db` (our fake storage) has the event stored with the correct values.
  * After that, we call `get_session` and ensure the persisted state matches and the event content is correctly reconstructed. This follows the ADK’s expectation that `append_event` applies state changes and that persistent services capture these changes.

* `test_search_memory_fulltext`: We simulate a user statement (“Paris is the capital of France”), append it, and add the session to memory. Then we query the memory for “capital of France”. Our fake `search_memory` implementation should return a result containing that snippet. We check that the snippet is present in the results. This validates the full-text search path. (We did not test vector search due to complexity of embedding in this context, but in a real test, one could inject a dummy embedding function and test that path similarly.)

These tests use a simplified in-memory dict `_db` to simulate what’s stored in Neo4j. In practice, one might use actual Neo4j with test data or more sophisticated mocks. The approach above, however, confirms that our service logic – ID generation, state handling, event serialization, search grouping – is functioning as intended, independent of the Neo4j driver.

## Configuration and Dependency Notes

To use these services, ensure you install the Neo4j Python driver. In the project’s `pyproject.toml`, we might add an optional dependency group for neo4j. For example:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
neo4j = ["neo4j>=5.0"]
```

Then users can install via `pip install google-adk[neo4j]`. The driver provides the `GraphDatabase.driver` interface we used. The code expects a Neo4j database (4.4 or 5.x) with APOC not strictly required, since we used built-in procedures for indexing. The Neo4j Bolt URI, user, and password must be provided to the service. For local testing, using the default `neo4j/neo4j` credentials on `bolt://localhost:7687` is common (update with your password).

If running in Docker, ensure the Neo4j container has APOC enabled if you plan to use APOC procedures (our code currently doesn’t require APOC). The vector index and full-text index used are part of Neo4j’s core (5.x) – no separate plugin needed, though note that vector indexes were introduced in 5.5 and improved in later 5.x versions. Full-text indexes have existed since 3.5 and are robust in 4.x/5.x.

**Neo4j Schema Setup:** On first use, `Neo4jSessionService` will create a uniqueness constraint on sessions. `Neo4jMemoryService` will attempt to create the fulltext and vector indexes. You’ll need appropriate permissions (the Neo4j user should have admin rights or the ability to create indexes). Alternatively, run these commands in Neo4j browser or Cypher shell:

* Create fulltext index for memory:

  ```cypher
  CALL db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex("MemoryTextIndex", ["Memory"], ["text"]);
  ```

  This index will index all nodes with the `Memory` label on their `text` property.

* Create vector index for memory (if using embeddings):

  ```cypher
  CALL db.index.vector.createNodeIndex("MemoryVectorIndex", "Memory", "embedding", <DIMENSION>, "cosine");
  ```

  Replace `<DIMENSION>` with your embedding vector length (e.g., 384 or 768). This sets up an ANN index for the `embedding` property using cosine similarity.

These commands are also invoked in our service constructors. If an index or constraint already exists, Neo4j may log a warning or error – we have used `IF NOT EXISTS` for the session constraint and simply call the index procedures (they will fail harmlessly if the index exists; in a real app, you’d catch the exception or use schema checks).

Finally, note that **unit tests** for these services in the ADK repository would likely use mocks rather than actual DB writes. Our tests followed that pattern by patching the database calls. The focus is on correctness of logic (e.g., state Delta application, JSON serialization) rather than testing Neo4j itself. In integration tests, you could populate a Neo4j instance, run the service methods, and assert on the stored graph (using `neo4j` client or APOC to verify data).

## Conclusion

We’ve implemented `Neo4jSessionService` and `Neo4jMemoryService` in a production-ready manner, aligning with ADK’s design principles and interfaces. These services enable persistent storage of conversations and long-term memory recall, leveraging Neo4j’s strengths: flexible graph representation and powerful indexing (full-text and vector). We carefully handled nested JSON data for content and actions, ensuring nothing is lost in translation.

By reviewing ADK’s existing services (InMemory and VertexAI) and Neo4j’s latest capabilities, we provided a robust solution:

* **Sessions**: reliably stored and retrieved with ACID guarantees, including state management and event history.
* **Memory**: supporting both exact keyword matches and semantic similarity search over past knowledge, using indexes to maintain query performance.

These additions to the ADK Python SDK would allow developers to use Neo4j as a backing store simply by swapping to these classes, opening up possibilities for rich analysis of conversation graphs and integration with other graph-based knowledge sources.
